1. Introduction to pmap Command:
"pmap stands for Process Memory Map. It shows the memory segments allocated by the OS to a process. When you run pmap on a process, it displays how the OS manages memory for that process â€” including code, libraries, stack, heap, and other memory regions."

2. Explanation of Each Section:
ðŸ§  Memory Regions:
The output consists of multiple memory regions, and each region is a segment of memory used by the process.


Column	Meaning
Address	Starting virtual address of the memory region
Size	Size of the memory region
Permissions	r = read, w = write, x = execute, - = no permission
Mapping	Describes what the memory region is (e.g., code, stack, heap)
ðŸ”¹ Code Segment:
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
00006513f36e1000      4K r-x-- p
"This is the code segment of the program. It has read (r) and execute (x) permissions. It is used for the actual program instructions."

ðŸ”¹ Heap & Stack:
Example (Stack):

bash
Copy
Edit
00007ffc13b9d000    132K rw---   [ stack ]
"This is the stack. The stack is used for function calls, local variables, and maintaining function call frames during program execution."

Example (Heap):

bash
Copy
Edit
00006513f756d000    132K rw---   [ anon ]
"This is anonymous memory used by the heap for dynamically allocated memory (e.g., variables created by malloc() or new)."

ðŸ”¹ Shared Libraries:
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
00007ef54ac00000    160K r---- libc.so.6
00007ef54ac28000   1568K r-x-- libc.so.6
"This shows shared libraries used by the program. Libraries like libc.so.6 are loaded by the kernel to provide common functions. Here we see read-only sections (r----) and executable sections (r-x--) of shared libraries."

ðŸ”¹ Total Memory:
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
total             6356K
"This is the total virtual memory used by the process, which in this case is about 6.3 MB."

3. Conclusion:
"The pmap command gives us a detailed view of how memory is allocated and managed for a running process by the OS. It helps us understand where different types of memory (code, data, stack, heap, shared libraries) are stored, and how much memory is used."

ðŸ“Œ Usage in OS Demos:
"By using pmap, we can visually explore memory management in action, which is a fundamental concept in operating systems. This shows how the OS dynamically assigns resources to processes while they run."
